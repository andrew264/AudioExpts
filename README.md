# Audio Experiments
## Why does this repository exist?
This repository is a collection of experiments with audio. The goal is to learn more about audio processing and architectures that can be used for generating audio.

## What does this repository contain?
### 1. [HiFi-GAN](model/hifi_gan.py)
This is an implementation of the HiFi-GAN model in PyTorch lightning. Contains code for training it on LibriSpeech dataset.

There will be more models and experiments added in the future...

## What is the purpose of this repository?
This is my playground for experimenting with audio/music. I will be adding more models and experiments as I learn more about other architectures and techniques.
The final goal is to add multimodality in [Smol-LM](https://github.com/andrew264/Smol-LM)

## Notes
- The code is not optimized for performance. It is written in a way that is easy for me to experiment with.
- Improvements and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
- Experiments with Images are done at [ImageExpts](https://github.com/andrew264/ImageExpts)
